# Resources
Various resources that I want to share.

A template that can be used for the NSERC CGS-M application. Takes into account the required font size/type, margins, lines per inch, etc.

## ResearchProposal-Workshop
Some slides I put together with advice on writing an NSERC CGS-M application.

## SURP-Applications
Successful statements of interest that I used to apply for the SURP program at the University of Toronto/Dunlap Institute in 2015 and 2016.

Examples of various documents you will need to produce throughout your thesis: a short thesis proposal for the first committee meeting, the full official thesis proposal for the thesis proposal defense, and a committee meeting report.
