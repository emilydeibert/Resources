# Resources
Various resources that I want to share.

## ResearchProposal-Template
A template that can be used for the NSERC CGS-M application. Takes into account the required font size/type, margins, lines per inch, etc.

## ResearchProposal-Workshop
Some slides I put together with advice on writing an NSERC CGS-M application.

## SURP-Applications
Successful statements of interest that I used to apply for the SURP program at the University of Toronto/Dunlap Institute in 2015 and 2016.
